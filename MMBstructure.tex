This section describes the key folders, in which the models, options, and rules are stored and briefly sketches the structure of the key files, which are used in the execution of the modelbase.

\subsection*{Key Folders}
 
Your installation of the MMB 3.0 contains a subdirectory 'resources/app/dist/electron/static/mmci-cli', which contains the .m-files and .mod-files for the models, rules and options being used in the comparison exercises. 
The subfolder\textit{MODELS} contains a specific folder for every model included in the MMB. The specific folders contain a single Dynare mod-file in which the particular model is specified as well as related MATLAB files, some of which are created by DYNARE. The subfolder \textit{MMB\_OPTIONS} contains specific MATLAB files related to the usage of the Modelbase for policy analysis and comparison, as well as explanatory notes for models and policy rules. The folder 
\textit{ALTOOLS} contains scripts for the use of models with adaptive learning. 

\subsection*{Some Key files}
The files discussed in this subsections are stored in the folder MMB\_OPTIONS.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CMB\_MMB.m}\\
This file receives the information on the selection of models rules and options that the user determines in the frontend of the modelbase. It checks, which operation platform is used, whether MATLAB or OCTAVE is employed and which version of Dynare is being used. Then it adds all other folders from the directory 'mmci-cli' to the path of MATLAB or OCTAVE. THen it loads relevant settings from MMB\_settings.m and defines key variables and names as well as a blank structure for the JSON, which will contain the simulation results as they are passed on to the frontend. The core of the file is a large loop over each selected model (index 'epsilon') and each selected policy rule (index 'i'). In each run of the loop, it sets the coefficients of the policy rule, solves the model in dynare, stores the results in the structure Modelbase.mat and passes the demanded output of the simulation on to the file Modelbase.json. The files Modelbase.mat and Modelbase.json are available in the same folder even after the simulations.
\item \textbf{MMB\_settings.m}\\
Among others this file contains the list of model names in the vector 'names', it sorts the models into categories calibrated, estimated on US data, etc. and stores for each model the dimension of the shocks in the original model ('variabledim'). Furthermore it contains the vectors with the rulenames and specifies which models have a model-specific rule, and which have not. In the next part, it defines the coefficients of the common policy rules. Lastly, it defines some options for the adaptive learning models.
\item \textbf{MSR\_COEFFS.m}\\
This file contains the list of coefficients for all model specific rules.
\end{itemize}
